Introduction</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">Welcome to DocTalk (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information with transparency and care. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, DocTalk (the &quot;App&quot;).

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not access or use the App.</p><p class="mb-4 font-semibold italic whitespace-pre-line">Please Note: DocTalk provides AI-powered information and analysis based on the documents and questions you provide. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Use of the App does not establish a doctor-patient relationship. You are solely responsible for the information you choose to share with the App.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Information We Collect</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">We collect information that you provide directly to us, information generated during your use of the App, and technical information about your device.

Account Information:
• User Identifier: A unique ID associated with your account (e.g., generated by our system or linked to your authentication method).
• Authentication Credentials: Information used for login (potentially email/password if implemented, or identifiers from third-party providers like Apple).
• Subscription Status: Information about your current subscription plan (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium), including purchase history identifiers relevant for validation.

Health Information and Documents You Provide:
• Chat Messages: Text queries, questions, and conversation content you type into the chat interface.
• Uploaded Documents: Medical documents, images, lab results, or other files (e.g., PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs) you choose to upload for analysis or discussion. This may contain sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI). We rely on you to only upload information you are comfortable sharing and have the right to share.
• Document Content Analysis: Information extracted or inferred from your uploaded documents during the AI analysis process.

Conversation Data:
• Chat History: Records of your conversations with the AI, including your messages and the AI&#x27;s responses.
• Citations: References provided by the AI in its responses.
• Archived Conversations: Saved conversations including messages and associated document identifiers (URLs).

Subscription and Purchase Information:
• Product Identifiers: The specific subscription product IDs (SKUs) you attempt to purchase or have purchased (e.g., com.doctalk.ai.subscription.standard).
• Transaction Receipts: Encrypted receipts provided by the relevant application store upon purchase. These are sent to our backend solely for validation with the application store provider and are not used for other purposes. We do not collect or store your full credit card number or other sensitive payment details. Payment processing is handled entirely by the application store provider.

Usage Data:
• Query Counts: Tracking the number of messages sent to manage subscription limits.
• Feature Usage: Information on how you interact with App features (e.g., use of Text-to-Speech, Advanced Research Mode, document uploads, archiving).

To Communicate with You (Rarely):
• Potentially send important notices regarding your account, subscription, or critical updates to the App or policies (we anticipate minimal direct communication).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. How We Share Your Information</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with third-party service providers and partners who perform services on our behalf, or as required by law, under the following circumstances:

• AI Service Provider(s): Your chat messages and potentially the content of uploaded documents (depending on the specific analysis requested) are shared with our third-party AI provider(s) to generate responses and perform analysis. These providers have their own privacy policies governing their use of data. We aim to minimize the data shared to what is necessary for the service.
• Application Store Provider: Transaction receipts are shared with the relevant application store provider via our backend for the sole purpose of validating your in-app purchases and managing your subscription status.
• Backend Hosting Provider: Our backend infrastructure, which processes requests and stores data like user accounts, conversation history, and validated subscription status, is hosted by a third-party backend hosting provider.
• Cloud Storage Provider: Your uploaded documents (images, PDFs) are stored with our cloud storage provider. Access is controlled via secure URLs linked to your conversations.
• Analytics Providers: We may use third-party analytics providers to understand App usage. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized where possible.
• Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
• Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via prominent notice within the App or via email (if available) of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.

We take steps to ensure that any third-party service providers with access to your information are obligated to protect it and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Data Storage and Security</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">At DocTalk, we implement a comprehensive, multi-layered security architecture designed to protect your sensitive information throughout its lifecycle. Our security measures include:

Frontend Security:
• Secure Storage: We use expo-secure-store to encrypt sensitive data stored on your device, including:
  - Authentication tokens
  - User data
  - Chat preferences
• Session Management: Automatic session tracking and monitoring of login times
• Input Validation: All user inputs are validated before being sent to our servers
• Protected Navigation: Secure navigation flows prevent unauthorized access to protected screens
• Clean Session Termination: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data on logout

Data Encryption:
• Transport Layer Security: All data transmitted between your device and our servers is protected using industry-standard encryption protocols.
• At-Rest Encryption: Your sensitive data, including messages and documents, is encrypted when stored using advanced encryption standards.
• Unique Encryption Keys: Each piece of sensitive data is encrypted with its own unique key, ensuring compartmentalized security.

Access Controls:
• Multi-Factor Authentication: Administrative access to backend systems requires multiple forms of verification.
• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): System access is strictly limited based on job function and necessity.
• Regular Access Reviews: We conduct periodic reviews of access permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.

Infrastructure Security:
• Secure Cloud Infrastructure: We utilize enterprise-grade cloud providers with extensive security certifications.
• Network Segmentation: Our infrastructure is organized into separate security zones with controlled access between them.
• Regular Security Updates: Systems are kept up-to-date with security patches and updates.

Monitoring and Incident Response:
• 24/7 System Monitoring: Automated systems monitor for suspicious activity or potential security threats.
• Incident Response Plan: We maintain and regularly update procedures for responding to potential security incidents.
• Regular Security Assessments: We conduct periodic security reviews and assessments of our systems.

Data Protection:
• Secure Document Storage: Uploaded documents are stored with enterprise-grade security controls.
• Automated Backup Systems: Critical data is regularly backed up with encryption.
• Data Retention Controls: Automated systems enforce data retention policies.

Important Note About AI Models:
It&#x27;s important to understand that among our AI services, only the Google Gemini Flash-2.0 vision model, used specifically for document analysis, has the capability to process and potentially associate users with their medical information. All other AI interactions are designed to be contextual without maintaining user associations. We implement strict security measures and data handling protocols to protect any information processed by these models.

Authentication and Authorization:
• Token-based Authentication: We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
• Password Requirements: Strong password policies requiring minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, and 1 special character
• Protected Routes: All sensitive operations require valid authentication tokens
• Automatic Session Validation: Tokens are validated on app startup and with each protected request</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Data Retention</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. This includes:

• Account Information: Retained for as long as your account is active.
• Conversation Data &amp; Uploaded Documents: Retained until you delete the conversation, request account deletion, or the conversation is otherwise removed according to our data management practices. Archived conversations are retained until deleted by you or upon account deletion.
• Subscription Data: Retained as long as necessary to manage your subscription status and for historical validation purposes.
• Encryption Keys: Securely stored for as long as needed to access your encrypted data, and securely destroyed when no longer needed.

Upon account deletion request, we will take reasonable steps to delete your personal information, subject to any legal or operational requirements to retain certain data (e.g., anonymized usage data, legally required records).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Your Rights and Choices</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:

• Access: You may have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you.
• Correction: You may have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information. (Note: Correcting conversation history or AI analysis content may not be feasible; deletion is often the primary mechanism).
• Deletion: You have the right to delete individual archived conversations within the App. You also have the right to request the deletion of your entire account and associated data by contacting us at zy@zymgmtco.com. Please note that deleting your account is irreversible and will result in the loss of all your conversation history and active subscriptions associated with that account.
• Manage Uploads: You control which documents you upload. Deleting a conversation containing documents will typically trigger the deletion of the associated stored files.
• Manage Permissions: You can manage App permissions (like camera or photo library access) through your device&#x27;s settings.
• In-App Purchases: Subscription management (cancellation, renewals) is handled through your application store account settings.

To exercise applicable rights, please contact us at zy@zymgmtco.com. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable law.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">8. Children&#x27;s Privacy</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">9. International Data Transfers</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. Our servers and third-party service providers (like AI providers, hosting) are primarily located in the United States. By using the App, you consent to this transfer.

When transferring data internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards:
• Data Transfer Agreements: We use appropriate data transfer mechanisms where required.
• Encryption in Transit: Data is encrypted during international transfers.
• Security Standards: We ensure receiving parties maintain appropriate security standards.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2><p class="mb-4 whitespace-pre-line">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the &quot;Effective Date&quot; at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of the revised policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">11.
